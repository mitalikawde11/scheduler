# Interview Scheduler

Interview scheduler is a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews between students and mentors. Appointments can be between the hours of 12 PM and 5 PM, Monday to Friday. Each appointment has one student and one interviewer. The front end of this project is built with React and makes requests to an API to fetch and store appointment data from a database.
